_(The ship comes back in the animation, due to the large file size I had to short the gif length)_

## Instructions (design side)

- Duplicate this [design file](https://www.figma.com/file/vObDBbBddW7gPosvMzkDYR/Figma-Scene/duplicate?node-id=0%3A1) and design it as you like 🏜
- Copy and paste your personal access token 🔐
- Copy and paste your file key 🔑
- Generate the scene! 🥳

## Tech (development side)

I'm using [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) to animate the scene. I've shared the animation as separate on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/AbubakerSaeed/pens/public) in case if you just want to explore the animation code 🙂
